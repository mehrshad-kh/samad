KNOWN ISSUES:
inc_meal_plan_head, and head aren't freed in ReserveFood()

admin >> food management >> meal plans >> list: 
	Doesn't show food name, lunchroom name, etc. Just IDs.
meal_types in lunchrooms: How should it be?
food_type in foods should be foreign key
Generic linked list?
Add methods to Lunchroom, MealPlan, etc.
Remove lunchroo feature
hash passwords with salt
add hotkey to stop opertaion

Check getline() with errno
